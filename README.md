## A Simple Face Recognition Application  
This is a face recognition application developed in Python.  

### Features  
- First, the face recognition model needs to be trained.  
- Once the application is launched, if a face is recognized, a second screen will open, leading to three simple Python applications:  
  - Password generation  
  - Counting words and letters in a text  
  - Searching for keywords in a file  

### Tools and Models Used  
This project uses OpenCV for face detection and recognition with:  
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**  
- **LBPH Face Recognizer**  

These models are part of the OpenCV library, which is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license.
