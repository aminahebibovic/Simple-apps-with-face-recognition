# Simple-apps-with-face-recognition
A simple face recognition application developed in Python. First, the face recognition model needs to be trained. Once the application is launched, if a face is recognized, a second screen will open, leading to three simple Python applications (password generation, counting words and letters in a text, and searching for keywords in a file).
